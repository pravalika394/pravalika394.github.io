        <p>My impression on my husband is I love my husband very much as he made me to realize the motive of my life in every instant by encouraging, motivating and guiding me . He is everything to me. His efforts in are immense and uncountable in shaping my career from the beginning. His patience never ends in pampering our TUKKU in my absence.
            In one word, He is just  amazing.!</p>

        <p>A Family can refer to a family where all the members have a good relationship with each other. It can also refer to the family members you see most – your parents (mother and father), siblings (brothers and sisters), and your children. For some people’s close family includes a stepparent (someone married to your mother or father who is not your genetic mother or father) or a stepbrother or stepsister (the child of a stepparent and another person who is not genetically-related to you. Another close family member might be a half-sibling (someone who shares one genetic parent with you.</p>

        <p>TUKKU responds for the word TUKKU for the first time at her infant days, so her name made a word to get introduced this world. I got inspired being a mother of a girl child. I see the colors of life in her. I never forget the instant at which she calls me “AMMA”(MOM).
            I love her every moment  with me!</p>
